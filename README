NAME

    Alien::raylib - Alien distribution for raylib video game engine

VERSION

    version 0.025

USAGE

    Use Graphics::Raylib::XS, which wraps this in XS, instead. Otherwise,
    just use it like any other Alien distro. Currently wraps raylib
    v2.1-dev (and a few extra commits, see the alienfile in this
    distribution)

System requirements

    Should build out of the box on macOS and Windows. On an Ubuntu Linux a
    few additonal packages are required:

        sudo apt-get install -y libasound2-dev \
            libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev mesa-common-dev \
            libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev \
            libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev

    If you also think these should be packaged as Alien modules, shoot me a
    pull request <https://github.com/athreef/Alien-raylib/pulls>.
