NAME

    Alien::raylib5 - Alien distribution for raylib video game engine,
    version 5 and above

ABSTRACT

    Alien distribution for Raylib version 5.5

VERSION

    version 0.026

USAGE

    Use Raylib::FFI, which wraps this, instead. Otherwise, just use it like
    any other Alien distro. Currently wraps raylib 5.5.

System requirements

    Should build out of the box on macOS and Windows. On an Ubuntu Linux a
    few additonal packages are required:

        sudo apt-get install -y libasound2-dev \
            libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev mesa-common-dev \
            libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev \
            libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev

    If you also think these should be packaged as Alien modules, shoot me a
    pull request.
