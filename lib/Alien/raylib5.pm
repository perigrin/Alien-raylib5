=head1 NAME

Alien::raylib5 - Alien distribution for raylib video game engine, version 5 and above

=head1 ABSTRACT

Alien distribution for Raylib version 5.5

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 USAGE

Use L<Raylib::FFI>, which wraps this, instead. Otherwise, just use it like any
other Alien distro. Currently wraps raylib 5.5.

=head1 System requirements

Should build out of the box on macOS and Windows.
On an Ubuntu Linux a few additonal packages are required:

    sudo apt-get install -y libasound2-dev \
        libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev mesa-common-dev \
        libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev \
        libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev

If you also think these should be packaged as Alien modules, shoot me a
pull request.
